I need You more
More than yesterday
I need You Lord
More than words can say
I need You more
Than ever before
I need You Lord
I need You Lord
More than the air I breathe
More than the song I sing
More than the next heartbeat
More than anything
And Lord as time goes by
I'll be by Your side
Cause I never want to go back
To my old life
I need You more
More than yesterday
I need You Lord
More than words can say
I need You more
Than ever before
I need You Lord
I need You Lord
More than the air I breathe
More than the song I sing
More than the next heartbeat
More than anything
And Lord as time goes by
I'll be by Your side
Cause I never want to go back
To my old life
I need You more
More than yesterday
I need You Lord
More than words can say
I need You more
Than ever before
I need You Lord
I need You Lord
I need You more
More than yesterday
I need You Lord
More than words can say
I need You more
Than ever before
I need You Lord
I need You Lord
We give You the highest praise
We give You the highest praise
More than the air I breathe
More than the song I sing
More than anything
I need You more
More than the air that I breathe
More than any song I could ever sing
So much more than anything
I need You more
You're all that I want, God
You're all that i want, God
I need You more
More than the air I breathe
More than the song I sing
More than anything
I need You more
More than the air I breathe
More than the song I sing
More than anything
I need You more
More than the air I breathe
More than the song I sing
More than anything
I need You more
More than the air I breathe
More than the song I sing
More than anything
I need You more
More than the air I breathe
More than the song I sing
More than anything
I need You more
